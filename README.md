This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). ```react-seo``` will help making react app SEO friendly as Google crawler needs static HTML pages to crawl the web pages and rank them up. We have achieved generating these static HTML pages by using [react-snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot).
